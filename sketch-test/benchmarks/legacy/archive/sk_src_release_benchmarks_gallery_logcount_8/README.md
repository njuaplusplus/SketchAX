# Description

This is the benchmark [logcount.sk](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/gal/logcount.sk.html) from Sketch.
It took 8 hours for Sketch to execute `sketch --bnd-unroll-amnt 50 -V 10 logcount.sk` to return the synthesized code.

Change `W=8` and works. It's fixed by permutation-invariant.
